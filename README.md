# DISCo-Net : **D**istributed, **I**nterpretable, and **S**calable computing for **Co-**authorship **Net**works

![DISCO-Net overview](<Screenshot 2024-09-30 at 12.12.52â€¯PM.png>)

An exponential growth in scientific literature necessitates the development of highly scalable computational tools that can effectively analyze and distill insights from complex, interconnected research landscapes. We introduce **D**istributed, **I**nterpretable, and **S**calable computing for **Co-**authorship **Net**works (DISCo-Net), a robust and scalable tool engineered to curate and examine large-scale co-authorship networks by harnessing the power of distributed computing and advanced relational database queries.

## Features

- Scalable interpretable model
- Distributed computing
- BERT based interpretable inference

## Usage

### Initial setup

1. Create a Python 3.8 or newer virtual environment.

    ```
    conda create -n disconet python=3.8
    source activate disconet
    ```

2. Install disconet by running,

    ```
    pip install pydisconet
    ```

## DISCo-Net extensively utilizes following for scalability
